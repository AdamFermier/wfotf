## The issue
Shortage of STEM candidates interested in pursuing a career in lifesciences.  In fact, among the 50 million employed college graduates ages 25 to 64 in 2019, 37% reported a bachelor’s degree in science or engineering but only 14% worked in a STEM occupation, according to the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey 1-year estimates.

This translates into less than a third (28%) of STEM-educated workers actually working in a STEM job.  We might have the resources, they just might not know the opportunities.

## Our Hypothesis

Developing a deliberate collaboration between academia and industry will help close the gap on the resource needs for future by educating all those involved about opportunities and possibilities to enable students to make more informed decisions given the diversity of input.

## Why this initiative is different

- Our goal  is to educate future Pharmaceutical Professionals ahead of joining the job market
- Industry wants in the long term to sustain and continue interactions with Academia
- We aim to work with Academia to develop integrated University curricula that will facilitate these professionals to have in immediate impact when they join the Industry
- We look for Industry and Academia interaction that will allow Academia to be involved in the Industry Innovation and Manufacturing and Control Process Management
