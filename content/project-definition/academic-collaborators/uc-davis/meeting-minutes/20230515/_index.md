Met to organize our thoughts around moving forward.  We landed on a concept that would lead to a content/course generation mechanism whereby students would work with industrial SMEs to develop and tailor current trends and learning goals for pharm manufacturing to a set of lectures that could be given to broader lecture.

## Learning Goals

The student would learn:
- The specifal topic
- How to create a lecture
- How to ensure assessment 
- Define different modes of teaching/learning
- Help build out that lecture in a web hosted framework

## Our Vision

Industrial experts and students working together to help create a content rich environment that can be used for lectures or self exploration.  The students will learn by teaching (train the trainers) 

## Our Mission

Leveraging time and talent from academia and industry - we shall create a digital knoweldge hub on the topic that helps describe real world issues and activities.
