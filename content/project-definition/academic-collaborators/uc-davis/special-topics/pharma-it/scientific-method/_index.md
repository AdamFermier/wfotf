## Problem

We were taught how to keep paper notebooks for scientific discovery and documentation.  But when it comes to digital it is often an "IT" problem and not a "Scientist" problem and thereby holistic design is not accounted for.

## Mitigation

Help educate digital methods and trends that scientists and engineers can use to capture their scientific process.

## Design Decisions

To keep things as nimble as possible, an open source tools criterian will have to be met with every tool - to ensure scalability globally.
