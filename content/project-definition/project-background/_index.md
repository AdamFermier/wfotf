# Our Common Focus: THE Students!

## Purpose:

We know that students are eager to learn more about what's possible in the career paths within the STEM [(Science, Technology, Arts and Math)](https://madsciguys.org) programs and bringing together industrial and academic teams to close this gap is a win for all involved:

- Students get to hear first hand from industrial experts their learnings and what it's like to be a professional STEM person working in either large or small organizations
- Faculty get directly involved to help stay abreast of the latest trends and help teach likewise to industrial collaborators
- Industrial participants are energized and motivated to help tell their story and how they contribute to help people around the world

## Remember to follow your passion and dreams
