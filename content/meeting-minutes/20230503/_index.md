We have covered the Status of the activities at the three FIT’s (UMBC, Purdue, UC Davis).

##	UMBC (Tony Moreira)

- The Students are writing their finals and make a presentation on Facilities Design for Vaccines Manufacturing and Cell & Gene Therapy Manufacturing.
- During the Fall Semester four new courses will be offered:
    - Pharmaceutical Career Course – 16 Industry lectures – The lectures will be offered on Monday evenings (5 to 6 PM).
    - Clinical Trial course and Intro to Statistics – The course will be delivered by the former FDA OTAT (office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies) Director Wilson Brian.
    - Vaccines Development & Manufacturing including Clinical Trials and Continuous Manufacturing
    - Summer Course: mAbs Analytical Testing – The course is being developed in collaboration with NIST.


## Purdue University  (Brad Beach & Dianne Tennenhouse)

- Brad has covered the “Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Institute” Project . This project has become part of the so called “ State of Indiana Workforce Ecosystem” where in the initiative are included Indiana Community Colleges, Industry Council (with 2-3 Top Profile Industry Representatives)  . There is interest to develop a Professional Master Program as well as during Fall a “Manufacturing Certificate”. “Workforce of the Future” Leadership will be interested to know if there is a role the “Workforce” Initiative will be asked to play. The “Purdue FIT” is charged to collect this information.

## UC Davis (Meli Gallup)

- Meli has contacted Prof. Glaucia Carvalho Do Prado to discuss the next steps for two short courses led by Adam Fernier and Tara Stonebarger. Glaucia has expressed an interest to build an Elective 10-week course to offer during Fall covering in addition to the two short courses also topics relevant for the students interested to join the Pharma Industry. 
1 Glaucia had earlier agreed to have the same “Career in Pharma” 14 lectures course developed at Purdue University and soon to be delivered at UMBC delivered at UC Davis too.
- Meli will come at the next UC Davis FIT with a final understanding for these two new initiatives.
- Phase II Profiles contacts update (Tony /Ferdinando)
    - Following last week meeting with Denneal Jamison McClug and Jackie Balderama, Ferdinando has sent 13Technical profiles to Denneal for her perusal to identify if there is any new interest to work together to pursue them.

Next Meeting:

- Thursday June 1 – 12 PM to 1 PM US EDT
- Zoom invite was issued on May 3, 2023
- Agenda will be issued by Ferdinando Aspesi around May 25th .

Best,
Ferdinando
