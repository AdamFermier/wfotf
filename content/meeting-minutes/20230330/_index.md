We have welcomed Brad Beach. He is added as Purdue University Representative representing the Purdue “ Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Institute” project.

We have covered the Status of the activities at the three FIT’s (UMBC, Purdue, UC Davis)

## Purdue University (Jo Davisson, Brad Beach)

-  Brad has covered the “Institute for Advanced Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals” Project and the opportunity to work together with the “Workforce of the Future” to define the courses to offer to Students to reach a “Certification” in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and potential Master Programs/Degrees in Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.
-  The current thought is to organize “Job Profile” Teams led by a Faculty Lead and an Industry Team Lead. This approach and feasibility need to be confirmed in the next weeks as well as identify which Profiles to pursue first.
-  A shorter version of Brad’s presentation is attached for your perusal and comments.
